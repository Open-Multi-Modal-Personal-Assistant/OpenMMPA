Notes:
1. A demo video of the app: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCtHH6XG5as
2. This project was submitted to the [Gemini API Developer Competition](https://ai.google.dev/competition).
3. Please find the related cloud functions - which comprise the back-end - in the
[Open Multi-Modal Personal Assistant](https://github.com/orgs/Open-Multi-Modal-Personal-Assistant/) organization.
Once the judging is over this repository will eventually be renamed and transferred there as well.
4. The repository state at the time of the submission was the last commit on August 12th before I recorded the demo:
https://github.com/CsabaConsulting/InspectorGadgetApp/tree/b7de11fa3d9122fd96b85e7c708802b371bb15c9
5. After the [Made By Google '24](https://store.google.com/intl/en/ideas/articles/made-by-google-recap/)
someone may compare Open MMPA to Gemini Live, however we must notice that:
   - Open MMPA targets embedded form factors
   - Open MMPA also features a local Vector Database for history and personal RAG
   - Open MMPA may lack some multi modal capabilities and integrations, but those are all planned

Initial application source code scaffold was generated by the [Very Good CLI][very_good_cli_link] ðŸ¤–
