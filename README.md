# Open Multi-Modal Personal Assistant

Existing AI pins (such as Humane Ai and Rabbit R1 turned out to be Android applications running
on the embedded devices). We already have our phones with us, or in many cases some smart watches.
This project instead of developing a new hardware aims to bring the full power of generative AI,
multi modal capabilities and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) personalization to enable
existing wearable and mobile devices.

## Multi Platform

Flutter allows iOS and other platform distributions as well.

## Voice Modality

The app is able to use native Android STT (Speech To Text) and TTS (Text To Speech) services,
but Google Chirp auto mode is capable of recognizing even more languages.

## Personalization

The app is able to remember personal details (for example dietary or health choices) and it'll
use that to be a greater help. Under the hood there's an on-device vector database which leverages
RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to factor in earlier conversations and personalization to
align better with the user.

## Popular Modes

1. Regular voice chat
2. Translation mode (always uses Chirp)
3. Multimodal: ask anything about a picture you see with the camera

## Large Language models

Currently uses Gemini 1.5 Flash and Gemini 1.5 Pro. There are several special tools the app can
leverage:
* The user's current location
* Weather prediction service (requires location)
* Sunrise and sunset information (requires location)
* Web research via Tavily (API Key required)
* Fiat and crypto currency exchange information

Under development:
* Web search via DuckDuckGo Assist
* Business knowledge (company performance, news, outlook) by Alpha Vantage, API Key required
* Song lyrics

Planned:
* Tools offered via SerpAPI
